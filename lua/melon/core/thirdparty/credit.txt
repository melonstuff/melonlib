-- Note that this is not a true version 4 (random) UUID.  Since `os.time()` precision is only 1 second, it would be hard
-- to guarantee spacial uniqueness when two hosts generate a uuid after being seeded during the same second.  This
-- is solved by using the node field from a version 1 UUID.  It represents the mac address.
--
-- 28-apr-2013 modified by Thijs Schreijer from the original [Rackspace code](https://github.com/kans/zirgo/blob/807250b1af6725bad4776c931c89a784c1e34db2/util/uuid.lua) as a generic Lua module.
-- Regarding the above mention on `os.time()`; the modifications use the `socket.gettime()` function from LuaSocket
-- if available and hence reduce that problem (provided LuaSocket has been loaded before uuid).
--
-- **Important:** the random seed is a global piece of data. Hence setting it is
-- an application level responsibility, libraries should never set it!
--
-- See this issue; [https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/478](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/478)
-- It demonstrates the problem of using time as a random seed. Specifically when used from multiple processes.
-- So make sure to seed only once, application wide. And to not have multiple processes do that
-- simultaneously.
